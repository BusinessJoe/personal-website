                    <a href="https://github.com/BusinessJoe/Gameboy-Emulator">GitHub</a>
                    <p>
                        Created a client-side broswer Gameboy emulator using Rust compiled to WebAssembly.
                        Performance was measured and optimized with the help of perf.
                    </p>

                    <strong>Full Circle</strong>
                    <a href="https://circles-lovat.vercel.app/">Website</a>
                    <a href="https://github.com/BusinessJoe/full-circle?tab=readme-ov-file">GitHub</a>
                    <p>
                        Created a website to algorithmically stylize images by recreating them with layered circles.
                        The algorithm uses a genetic process to select each circle sequentially.
                        Developed in Rust and compiled into WebAssembly to run locally in the browser.

                    <p>
                        Created a Python application to generate and visualize higher-dimensional kaleidoscopes.
                        Kaleidoscopes can be viewed and interacted with through a PyQt GUI.
                        Calculations to generate the kaleidoscopes are implemented with NumPy for numerical computation efficiency.
